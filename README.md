# Swipe Interview Assistant 

This project is my submission for the Swipe internship assignment.  
It’s a simple **AI-powered interview assistant** that helps interviewers and candidates conduct and evaluate interviews in a structured way.


# What it does
- Lets a candidate upload their resume (PDF/Doc).  
- Extracts basic details like name, email, phone (or allows manual entry).  
- Starts an "automated interview" with timed questions.  
- Auto-submits answers when time is up.  
- Scores and summarizes answers at the end.  
- Interviewer gets a dashboard to:
  - View candidate list
  - Search/sort candidates
  - Open a candidate’s report to see:
    - Each question
    - Candidate’s answer
    - Whether it was correct/incorrect
    - The expected correct answer
